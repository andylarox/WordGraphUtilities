# WordGraphUtilities
Utilities for generating word relationship graphs.

Repository for the code I use to generate word relationship graphs. 
I will be putting all my utilities here and keeping them updated as I improve them.

These are currently set for small, infant vocabulary graphs (circa 420 nodes). I will be adding the option to generate adult-size vocabulary graphs too.

These utils use mysql to get node names. I will be adding an option to use csv only.
